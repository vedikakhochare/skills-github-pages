 GitHub Pages is a static site hosting service that takes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files straight from a repository on GitHub, optionally runs the files through a build process, and publishes a website. You can see examples of GitHub Pages sites in the GitHub Pages examples collection.

You can host your site on GitHub's github.io domain or your own custom domain. For more information, see "Configuring a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site."

You can create GitHub Pages sites that are publicly available on the internet. Organizations that use GitHub Enterprise Cloud can also publish sites privately by managing access control for the site. For more information, see "Changing the visibility of your GitHub Pages site" in the GitHub Enterprise Cloud documentation.

To get started, see "Creating a GitHub Pages site."

Organization owners can disable the publication of GitHub Pages sites from the organization's repositories. For more information, see "Managing the publication of GitHub Pages sites for your organization."
